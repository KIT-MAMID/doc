\section{Development Process}
\subsection{CI (Jenkins)}\label{ci}
On each push a GitHub webhook triggers a Jenkins instance to build the head commit of the pushed commits. While building, Jenkins marks the 
commit to indicate whether the target passed or not.

Jenkins utilzes two remote build nodes: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item A node on a Linux server
	\item A node on a openindiana server 
\end{itemize}
Therefore artifacts for both Linux and openindiana can be produced and tested.

Jenkins executes the folowing Makefile targets on both nodes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \codeinline{check\_format}
	\item \codeinline{vet}
	\item \codeinline{test}
	\item \codeinline{build}
	\item \codeinline{cover}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Workflow}
Each change of the code have to be implemented in a seperate feature branch since the master branch is protected on GitHub. The protection 
only allows changes to be pushed on master if the following constraints are fulfilled:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The change can be applied fast forward
	\item The change passes all required checks on the \hyperref[ci]{CI}, which are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the \codeinline{check\_format} makefile target succeeds
		\item the \codeinline{vet} makefile target succeeds
		\item the \codeinline{test} makefile target succeeds on both Linux and openindiana
		\item the \codeinline{build} makefile target succeeds
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
