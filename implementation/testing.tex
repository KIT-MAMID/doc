\section{Testing}

\subsection{Unit Tests}
Earlier in the development process unit tests where written to test the behavior of single components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Master API was tested by sending manually checked json objects --- mocking the HTTP server --- and checking the changes in the database
	\item The Cluster Allocator was tested for idempotency by fetching the whole database after two consecutive Cluster Allocator runs and comparing them using deep equal
	\item The Monitor and Deployer were tested by creating scenarios in the database and asserting the changes in the database and checking the sent bus messages
	\item The slaves process management was tested by starting a mocked Mongod process
	\item The notifier was tested against a mocked master api and with generated config files
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration Tests}

Setup of automated integration tests would be possible by calling the HTTP API of the Master in the local staging environment and asserting the results.

But as integration begun only 2 weeks before the deadline setup of automated integration tests would have been to time consuming.
Instead the local staging environment was used to manual tests after potentially critical changes.
