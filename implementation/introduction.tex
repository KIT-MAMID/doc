\mamid (\emph{Monitor and Manager for In-memory Databases}) is a manager for database clusters, facilitating creation,
administration and monitoring of a MongoDB Replica Set deployment.

This document is a report on the implementation and testing of \mamid, subdivided into

\begin{itemize}
        \item a listing of deviations from the original \emph{application design}
        \item a description of the development process \& tools
        \item an overview of the testing employed to stabilize the software %TODO find better wording, but this can't be left out
\end{itemize}

In order to facilitate lecture of this document, the reader should be familiar with the contents of the \emph{Functional Specification}
document as well as the \emph{Design} document.
