\section{Criteria}

TODO foreach criteria in functional spec (maybe group some of them together), report on
	- which are implemented
		- if implementation differs, explain how and why
	- which are not implemented

=> Macro for referencing???

\subsection{Required Criteria}

\subsection{Optional Criteria}

we added a lot of things that weren't mentioned in the funcspec => see design Improvements and mention them, too

\subsection{Demarcation Criteria}

just list them and state we stuck to them
