The MasterSlaveProtocol \refgo{msp} implements communication between \refgo{slave} and \refgo{master}.\\
There are two structures which may be sent directly over HTTP as request body, represented with JSON:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \codeinline{[]\reftype{Mongod}} An array of descriptions of all Mongod instances of that \refgo{slave}.
  \item \codeinline{\reftype{Error}} Sent (only) by \refgo{slave} in case there are general problems preventing observation of any running Mongod instances.
\end{itemize}

For several datastructures in \refgo{msp}, similar ones exist in  \refgo{model}. The reasoning behind this is the desire to have a
stable protocol format for the \refgo{msp}: the JSON objects are auto-generated during runtime via reflection.
Hence, duplication of datastructures is a necessary tradeoff in order to sustain the principle of information hiding.

% server (slave) side structures

  Structure for handling communication through the MasterSlaveProtocol on the \refgo{slave} side.
}{
  \property{Consumer}[\reftype{Consumer}]{
    Reference to an event handler, typically a controller.
  }
}{
  \method{Run}{
    Start listening for connections using the MasterSlaveProtocol.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Listen for incoming connections from the \refgo{master}.
      \item Decode / Encode the transport format.
      \item Validate incoming request format.
      \item Delegate valid requests to the \reftype{Consumer}.
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \method{RequestStatus}[{([]\reftype{Mongod}, *\reftype{Error})}]{
    %TODO reference request message object here -> proto specification
    Request to provide a status report of the slave's state.

    \param{m}[\reftype{Mongod}]{State description of a Mongod instance that shall be established.}
  ){
    %TODO reference request message object here -> proto specification
    Request to establish the configuration state $m$ of a MongoDB process on the slave.
    May return an error in case the state could not be established.

  \method{RequestStatus}[{([]\reftype{Mongod}, \reftype{error})}]{
    Send a status request to the \refgo{slave} to retrieve all the running \reftype{Mongod} instances. May return an instance of \reftype{error} in case overall retrieving failed.

  \method{EstablishMongodState}[*\reftype{CommunicationError}](
    \param{m}[[]\reftype{Mongod}]{Array of \reftype{Mongod} instances to establish}

    Sends the array of \reftype{Mongod} instances to the \refgo{slave} which is tasked with creating and configuring the described processes.
